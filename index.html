      <h1>Early Life & Career</h1>
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Dihrubhai Ambani was born in a Modh baniya family to Hirachand
          Govardhandas Ambani and Jamanaben in the village of Chorwad in the
          district of Junagarh. His father was employed as a school teacher
          while his mother was a homemaker.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Raised in frugal living conditions, right from an early age, he was
          aware of the insufficiencies that the family dealt with due to the
          meagre income of his father and large expenses.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          While at school at Junagarh, he was elected as the General Secretary
          of the Junagarh State Union. He organized a rally on Indian
          Independence Day, defying the rules of the Nawab, head of the state.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Next, he became a part of the Praja Mandal Movement that organized
          rallies to bring about constitutional reforms in the state. The result
          was the fleeing of the Nawab to Pakistan and Junagarh being a part of
          the Indian Union. It was his passion and active political involvement
          that brought him to the notice of political leaders.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          In 1949, a new Socialist party emerged from the Congress of which he
          found himself a part of. For the upcoming municipal elections in
          Junagarh, he started campaigning for his favourite candidates, which
          eventually resulted in their victory. Though he was offered a place in
          the Party, he declined the offer to walk on road of his true calling.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Leaving aside his political pursuits, he concentrated on academics and
          gave his matriculation exams. However, due to the ill health of his
          father and impoverished living condition of the family, he had to give
          up on his education and take up a job offered in Aden(now in Yemen).
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          At Aden, he took up a clerical job at A. Besse & Co, the largest
          transcontinental trading firm east of Suez. The company dealt with
          trading all sorts of goods to European, American, African and Asian
          companies.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Curious to learn the tricks of the trade, he soon started working
          simultaneously for a Gujarati trading firm. It was there that he
          learnt accounting, book keeping and preparing shipping papers and
          documents. He also acquired the skill of dealing with banks and
          insurance companies.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Soon he took to speculative trading, in all sorts of goods and made
          profitable deals, a fact which made his competitors think of him
          having a knack for trade. He was then promoted to the oil filling
          station at the newly built harbour. It was therein that thoughts of
          building a refinery first shaped his dream.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Meanwhile, Yemeni movement for independence curtailed opportunities
          for Indians living in Aden. Thus, he moved back to India in 1958 and
          started exploring business opportunities in Bombay.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Since he could not make large investments, he settled as a spice
          trader under the name Reliance Commercial Corporations. He soon
          started trading spices, sugar, jaggery, betel nuts and such to Gulf
          Emirates. He focused on low profits, high volumes and rich quality.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Not the one to be contented easily, he soon shifted focus to yarn
          trading, which though had high levels of risks involved, promised
          richer dividends as well. Starting on a small scale, he soon made big
          deals in yarn to the point of being elected a director of the Bombay
          Yarn Merchants Association.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          His foresightedness and ability to judge helped him crack two most
          hefty deals in the yarn market that earned him the flush of capital
          required for the future Reliance Textiles. Playing on his idea of
          establishing a manufacturing unit, he soon realized the same by
          setting up a textile mill in Naroda, Ahmedabad in 1966.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Every weekend, he flew from Bombay to Ahmedabad to check on the
          progress of the establishment of the factory and troubleshoot any
          problems faced by the workers. His main aim was to produce the best
          quality nylon in the quickest way possible and in largest quantities.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          He tripled the workforce to fasten the building of the factory.
          However, a drop in the valuation of the rupees globally steepened the
          project costs. Nevertheless, not the one to get scared to taking
          risks, he continued with the project.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          By August 1966, the construction work had finished and the equipment
          and machineries were being installed to meet the September 1 deadline
          of starting off with the productions. Meanwhile, he accumulated a
          workforce of 35 men from Calcutta, Indore and Bombay to work in the
          factory. Production started as planned on September 1, 1966 but took a
          couple of months to stabilize.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          By January 1967, his dreams started to realize as the Naroda factory
          began producing the finest quality of Nylon; but the new company had
          no buyers in the market as the wholesalers refused to buy fabric from
          Reliance at the instance of established big mill owners.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Not the one to accept defeat, he soon stepped out on the road and
          started selling his stock directly to retailers. His daring attitude
          and gutsy behaviour impressed all and soon the market for ‘Vimal’, the
          name of his fabric, grew and started expanding. In no time, it became
          the finest, best-selling fashion fabric of its times.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Increased demand led to increased sales and greater profits. With the
          excess money, he started expanding his mill by adding new machineries
          and better facilities for workers. Soon the Reliance family grew large
          and prosperous with influx of a whole new gamut of fresh and
          experienced workers.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          By 1972, Reliance became huge and thriving, a stark contrast to its
          starting days. Three years later, it received a nod of excellence from
          the World Bank, a fact that speeded the upgradation and expansion of
          all plant operations.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          In 1981, his elder son Mukesh joined the business and he initiated
          Reliance's backward integration journey from textiles into polyester
          fibres and further into petrochemicals, petroleum refining and going
          up-stream into oil and gas exploration and production
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          In 1983, his younger son, Anil Ambani joined the business and took
          over as the chief executive officer at Naroda.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Between 1984 and 1996, the mill experienced a grand makeover as
          computerized and high-tech machines replaced the old traditional ones
          making Reliance the grandest composite mill in the country.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Over the period of time, the Reliance industries diversified into
          other sector, such as, telecommunications, information technology,
          energy, power, retail, textiles, infrastructure services, capital
          markets, and logistics.
